**Technologies:**

> This webpage was created using HTML,CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and React.js.

**Future Development:**

> In the future, it would be exciting to add more JavaScript to this webpage to make it a more dynamic experience for the user. Also adding more CSS animations could showcase my experience creating a web browser
